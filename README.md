# BombermanJS

# Our goal:
Was to generate a working grid and implement socket.io so any players connected to the server can see each other as well as see the bombs that each player is throwing.

# The parts that work:

The map is functional and every player can see each other when connected.

# The parts that don't work:
1) When a player disconnects from the server, the server freezes.
2) While refactoring and creating a Bomb class, our bombs don't render and the server freezes.

# DO NOT CLICK!!!

# Open/unresolved questions:
1) Efficiency to make our game run faster/smoother
2) 3D sprite design
3) Code bloat and refactoring questions

# Instructions:
1) npm run build-watch
2) npm start
3) start on localhost:1337

4) go to bomberjs.herokuapp.com
