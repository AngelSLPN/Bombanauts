### Introduction
[Bombanauts](http://bomberjs.herokuapp.com/), inspired by the original [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) game, is a 3D multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game where players can throw bombs at each other, make boxes explode, and even other players! Bombs explode into a cross of fire down the aisles destroying crates that stand in their way. The flames do not spawn on stones or walls. When the flames make contact with the wooden boxes (and players :smiling_imp:) they explode!

### How Do I Play?
Your goal is to blow up the other players before they blow you up! Destroy crates to get to the other players and show no mercy!

### Controls
**Press** `WASD` to move around

**Press** `SPACE` to throw a high velocity bomb

**Click** to plant a bomb in front of you

**Press** `ENTER` to open the chat

**Press** ` (Back Tick) to close the chat

**Press** `ESC` to regain control of the cursor (and to see the instructions again)

**Click** the speaker image to mute and unmute the volume

**Move** the mouse to look around

### Gameplay
Players spawn in the 4 different corners and must destroy crates to get to each other and fight till the last one is standing or the timer runs out. Each map is randomly generated for a unique game every time!

### Tips and Tricks
- Be careful! You can kill yourself!
- If you aim carefully you can throw a bomb around a corner!
- You cannot throw bombs over walls, boxes, or boulders
- You have a strong throwing arm. Throw bombs at other bombs to bounce them away
- Bombs can bounce off of everything! (including other players and bombs!)
- The explosions are big so they tell other players where you might be
- Throwing bombs will give you more distance
- Planting bombs will give you more control over where they go
